# MotoHud

The goal of this project is to create a low cost display that can be mounted to the handlebars or fairing of any motorcycle to provide an augmented visualization of the riders route navigation. GPS navigation is handled via a users phone and is sent wirelessly over bluetooth to this display. The display is designed to be minimally distracting and provides the following information to the rider:

* Direction of next turn.
* Distance to next turn.
* Lane assistance.
* Time to destination.
* Speed cameras.
